WinCache Admin Tool
========================================
This plugin is for the WinCache PHP extension[1] to provide "phpinfo()" style
information and statistics about WinCache usage. It is basically the WinCache
statistics page[2] converted into a Moodle plugin to provide easy access from
within the Site Administration menu. This is a great addition if you use the
Moodle Universal Cache (MUC) WinCache Store[3] to monitor its usage.


Installation
----------------------------------------
Copy the plugin 'wincache' folder from your download to your 'moodle/admin/tool'
folder. Then login as a Moodle admin to install the plugin/add-on. At that point
you can access the WinCache page from [Site Admin > Server > WinCache info]
